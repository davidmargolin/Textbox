<strong>TextBox</strong> is a cross platform service that allows users to save and access text/media on any of their devices with or without a network connection.

<strong>Why TextBox?</strong><br>
For those times when our phones are <strong>low on storage</strong> or when weâ€™re having a hard time accessing our photos/docs because the <strong>internet sucks</strong>.
<br>TextBox is super light weight. Actually <strong>NO WEIGHT</strong> at all. Just text!

<strong>How to Use?</strong>
- Send your text/media to <strong>(205)564-9506</strong>. We'll ask you to name it and take care of the rest. 
- Enter "find" and the name of your item to get it back. 
- Enter "delete" and the name to delete the item. 
- Enter "list" to get a list of recently saved items. 
- Enter "help" to get more useful infomation.
<br>(We support images, gifs, videos, and text)

Oh and there's an amazing web interface that lets you do all of these things too. It's live at https://neverrunoutof.space
<br>So whether you're on your phone, your laptop, with internet or without, use TextBox to manage your storage.

Our backend is written in <strong>Nodejs</strong>, the frontend in <strong>React</strong>. We use <strong>Twilio</strong> to send messages, <strong>Google Cloud</strong> to manage storage and host our frontend, <strong>Mongodb Atlas</strong> for fast search, and <strong>Giphy</strong> to tie everything together.
