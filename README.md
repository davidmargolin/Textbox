<strong>TextBox</strong> is a cross platform service that allows users to save and access text/media on any of their devices with or without a network connection.

<strong>Why TextBox?</strong><br>
There’re times that we get into an awkuard situation that our phones are <strong>low in storage</strong>. Or we’re having hard time accessing your photos/docs online becuase the <strong>internet sucks</strong>.
<br>TextBox is super light weight. Actually <strong>NO WEIGHT</strong> at all, just text.

<strong>How to Use?</strong>
- Text your text/media to <strong>(205)564-9506</strong>. We'll ask you to name it and take care of the rest. 
- Enter "find" and the name to get your item back. 
- Enter "delete" and the name to delete the item. 
- Enter "list" to get a list of recently saved items. 
- Enter "help" to get more usefull infomation.
<br>(We support images, gifs, videos, and text)

Oh and there's an amazing web interface that lets you do all of these things too. It's live at http://neverrunoutof.space
<br>So whether you're on your phone, your laptop, with internet or without, use TextBox to manage your storage.

Our backend is written in <strong>Nodejs</strong>, the frontend in <strong>React</strong>. We use <strong>Twilio</strong> to send messages, <strong>Google Cloud</strong> to manage storage and host our frontend, <strong>Mongodb Atlas</strong> for fast search, and <strong>Giphy</strong> to tie everything together.
